Multiple Object Detection:-

- OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

- Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- A powerful N-dimensional array object
- Sphisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional
container of generic data.
- Arbitrary data-types can be defined. this allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

Requirements:-
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- COCO Model
